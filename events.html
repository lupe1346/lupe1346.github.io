        <h2>West Indian Day Parade</h2>
          <p>
            The parade takes place on Labor Day and always promotes skin, feathers and sequins, with music and flags that celebrate the heritage of Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, Barbados, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and Grenada, Guyana, Suriname and Belize, among others. The partygoers often dress up as political figures or celebrities and throw powdered paint at each other, while steel drums and whistles provide the celebratory soundtrack. There are food vendors providing traditional dishes for this exuberant day of celebration.
