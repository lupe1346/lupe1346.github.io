        <!-- Number Two: Grand Central Terminal -->
        <p> Grand Central Terminal:</p>
          <br></br>
      <p>
        The Grand Central terminal, also known as the “Crown jewel,"
        is New York City's number one train transportation system.
        The terminal is also connected to the subway and the bus system.
        But besides the trains and the very friendly staff, the
        Grand Central Terminal is so much more that!
        If you like shopping, visit one the 60 shops they have
        and then grab food or a coffee drink in the more than 35 cafes and dining areas.
        There are also special events that happen all year round,
        all under one roof. And if you like taking pictures,
        or capturing the moment, the Grand Central
       is a great place to take family photos, selfies,
        or photos of someone you love.

     <!-- Number Three: The Statue of Liberty Map -->

        <h3 class="ariTitle">Statue of Liberty:</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        The Statue of Liberty was given to us by the people
        of France in the year of 1886.
        It was given to us as a symbol of friendship.
        Now, almost 90 years later, it has more symbolism as well.
        While it does still symbolize friendship,
        it now symbolizes democracy, freedom, hope and love.
        People who come and see this with their very own eyes
        will feel joy, happiness and some sort of gratitude.
